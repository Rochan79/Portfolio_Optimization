# Portfolio Optimization
This project covers optimization of a marketing portfolio using Linear Programming

## Problem Description

Marketing budgets now comprise 11 percent of total company budgets, based on a CMO survey
sponsored by the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, Deloitte LLP, and the American
Marketing Association. However, the effectiveness of marketing varies significantly: on the one hand,
P&G cut more than $100 million in digital marketing spending because their digital ads were largely
ineffective; on the other hand, Netflix plans a 54% boost in ad spending because they got very positive
feedback in international markets.
One potential reason for such variation is the way of making marketing budget allocations. Namely, how
much to invest in each advertisement platform. As stated in the Handbook of Marketing Analytics:
    ...budget decisions are often based on gut feelings or on the negotiation skills of individual
    managers. Consequently, politics and individual opinions tend to shape the decision process
    instead of fact-based discussions. Obviously, these rules and practices bear the risk of results far
    away from the optimal, profit-maximizing budget.
    
In this project, we use linear programming to build a simple marketing budget allocation strategy.

All code can be found in the Jupyter notebook within this repository. 


## Specifics covered

- Formulated the marketing budget allocation given the ROIs provided from an external consulting firm and internal constraints
- Comparing allocations between 2 consulting firms across multiple advertising channels
- Stabilizing the budget to ensure spend across each channel does not exceed a maximum to diversify the budget
